This work presents a DCIM macro designed to address the challenges in state-of-the-art works, specifically focusing on reducing the overall area utilisation of the SRAM array and the adder tree. I presented a novel NOR8T SRAM bitcell for compute-in-memory operation and two full adders, 8T and 
10T, used in the 2D interleaving adder tree. which mitigates the threshold voltage drop issue of the bitcell and the voltage drop from the RCAs. The design has 68% area utilisation and 57% power reduction in comparison to conventional adder tree designs. The design achieves a maximum throughput of 1.63 TOPS at 66 MHz and at 1.2 V utilising CMOS 65 nm 
technology.The macro is evaluated for 4A4W configurations for the LeNet-5 network using MNIST datasets, achieving 99.14% inference accuracy.
